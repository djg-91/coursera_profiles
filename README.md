This is my final project for the University of Michigan's specialization "Web Applications for Everybody".

It is a webpage to manage a university's profile applications. Below you may find a demo to it:

## Requirements

1. The webpage needs a PHP server, a SQL server and a Web server. 
   For this project I used MAMP which gives you a PHP server, MySQL server and Apache server in one tool. 
   You may download MAMP from https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/

2. Create a SQL database and configure it's ODBC's connection string in the file pdo.php.
